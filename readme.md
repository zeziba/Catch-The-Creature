### Purpose
This project was developed to satisfy a completion requirement of a Java class I took in college.

### Intent
This program is a simple clicker where the player will click the active enemy on the screen to
score points. The faster and more consecutive the clicks the higher the score will go for
each click. If the player fails to click on the enemy before it disappers the modifier will reset
and base points will be awarded.

The game features 3+ enemies to click on and several areas to do so. It also features
a rotating background music selection that plays while attempting to get a high score.

There are sound effects for shooting at the enemy and visual feedback when a hit occurs.
